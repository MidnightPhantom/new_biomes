# underground_biomes
This mod was intended to give the boring underground of Minetest a new set of productive biomes where you can explore the underground without worrying 
about any falling block falling in the void. And most of all you can now find ore decorations underground. 

# What I intend to do in future
Add water bodies
Add more plants
More Biomes
Nicely spread biomes
